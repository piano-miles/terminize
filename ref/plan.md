# Todo

## Major

- Multiple choice study method
- GPT integration

## Minor

### Immidiate

- Create a 'help' page detailing the study format and how to use the site

### Long-term

- Add support for more filetypes
- Choosing delimiters on `import` page
- Script to list and import example study sets
- Brainstorm third study method
  - GPT API?
    - If users use my token, then I would need a way for users to transfer money. Which is clunky. Especially considering I don't have any users anyway...
    - Users could input their own API key, but that would be a hassle for them. Still, it is probably the best course of action for now.

## Bugs

- The animation is odd when the focused card is left on the definition flip state while the user switches to a new card.
