# Terminize

## Description

Terminize is a study tool designed to help students learn and recall information by practicing term-definition pairs in various categories. It is an interactive and customizable tool that allows students to choose the difficulty level and track their progress over time.

## Actuality

In actuality... I just wanted to make my own term-definition study website, lol. I do not plan on making it too robust or anything.

For now, it will serve simply as a concept and a little passion project, and I may hardcode some Psychology terms. In the future, I may adapt it to accommodate custom study sets, or maybe even something more advanced from the description above (selecting difficulty, tracking progress, etc).

I would also love to use the [ChatGPT API](https://platform.openai.com/docs/quickstart) to do some really cool stuff, but I probably won't since I do not want to spend my own money and do not currently intend to monetize this concept in any way. I will probably just use this for my own personal use.
