# Terminize

(Visit [here](https://piano-miles.github.io/terminize/))

## Description

Terminize is a study tool designed to help students learn and recall information by practicing term-definition pairs in various categories. It is an interactive and customizable tool that allows students to choose the difficulty level and track their progress over time.

## Actuality

In actuality... I just wanted to make my own free and ad-free term-definition study website. I do not plan on making it too robust or anything, as this is just a little passion project of mine.

For now, it will serve simply as a concept and a little passion project, and I may hardcode some Psychology terms. In the future, I may adapt it to accommodate custom study sets, or maybe even something more advanced from the description above (selecting difficulty, tracking progress, etc).
