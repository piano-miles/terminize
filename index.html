        <h2 id="description">Description</h2>
        <p>Terminize is a study tool designed to help students learn and recall information by practicing
            term-definition pairs in various categories. It is an interactive and customizable tool that allows students
            to choose the difficulty level and track their progress over time.</p>
        <h2 id="actuality">Actuality</h2>
        <p>In actuality... I just wanted to make my own free and ad-free term-definition study website. I do not plan on
            making it too robust or anything, as this is just a little passion project of mine.</p>
        <p>For now, it will serve simply as a concept and a little passion project, and I may hardcode some Psychology
            terms. In the future, I may adapt it to accommodate custom study sets, or maybe even something more advanced
            from the description above (selecting difficulty, tracking progress, etc).</p>

            <li>Some downloadable study sets. You can download one of these sets yourself and upload the file to import
                it on the actual Terminize website.</li>
